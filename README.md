### 👨‍💻 About Me

**My journey with technology started early.** What began as creative play in **Scratch** and courses at **Giganci Programowania** (Coding Giants) quickly turned into a genuine passion for engineering

In high school, I combined my love for logic and gaming by participating in "Math Meetings" (*Spotkania z matematyką*). I delivered a presentation on **"Mathematics in Games,"** exploring the algorithms behind virtual worlds. That experience sparked my deep curiosity about how software is built "under the hood"

I am a **technology enthusiast** and a highly **open-minded person**. I value communication and connecting with people. Currently, I'm focusing on creating tools that optimize workflows, like my latest chatbot project

**🏃 Personal:** I am a marathon finisher and a highly ambitious person who loves challenges. I believe that both coding and long-distance running require the same mindset: consistency, hard work, and the determination to always reach the finish line
