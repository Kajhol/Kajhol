### 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a builder at heart. My journey started with a fascination for logic in games, but today, I focus on **solving real-world business problems** through code

As a student at **Politechnika Śląska**, I combine academic fundamentals (Algorithms, C++) with modern development practices. Currently, I am deeply invested in the **Generative AI** space, building tools that bridge the gap between complex technology and everyday business needs

My goal isn't just to write code. I want to deliver solutions that save time and optimize workflows

**🏃 Personal:** I am a **marathon finisher**. I believe that engineering requires the same mindset as long-distance running: consistency, resilience, and the determination to reach the finish line, no matter the distance
